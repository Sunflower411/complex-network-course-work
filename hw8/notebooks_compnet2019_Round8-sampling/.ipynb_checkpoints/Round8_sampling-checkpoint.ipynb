    "# Round 8. Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you can use the provided Python template `sampling.py` or this notebook for reference. The usage of the notebook or template is **optional**. Then you only need to fill in the required functions. Some of the functions do NOT need modifications. You may start your solution after the subtitle \"**Beginning of the Exercise**\" down below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to returning a short report of your results (including the visualizations), return also your commented Python code or notebook. Remember to label the axes in your figures!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many network data sets are samples of some underlying graphs that we are actually interested in. That is, nodes and edges of these empirical networks have been sampled in a way that we only observe parts of them. This can severely bias even the most simple network measures we compute in a way that the values the measures get for the sampled graph can be very different than for the underlying graph.\n",
    "In this exercise we will see the effect of three different sampling schemes on network transitivity $C$ and derive estimators that can be used to correct for these biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first recall the definition of transitivity $C$, defined during the lectures as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "C =\\frac{\\tau_{\\triangle}}{\\tau_{\\angle}} = \\frac{\\sum_i E_i}{\\sum_i {k_i \\choose 2}}\\,, %=\\frac{\\text{3} \\times \\text{number of triangles in the network}}{\\text{number of two-stars in the network}}\\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_{\\angle}$ is the number of two-stars (a node and two of its neighbors), $\\tau_{\\triangle}$ is three times the number of triangles (two-stars in which the neighbors are connected), $i$ is a node, $k_i$ is the degree of $i$, and $E_i$ is the number of triangles centered on $i$ (in other words, how many triangles pass by $i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator to get a better estimate of $\\tau_{\\triangle}$ and $\\tau_{\\angle}$ under different sampling schemes. We will then use these estimators to get an estimator for $C$ by simply plugging them in the formula for $C$. In short, HT is a weighted estimator, where the weights are determined by the inverse of the probability of observations. This way, observations that are more unlikely to be sampled have a larger weight, and observations that are more likely to be sampled have a smaller weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HT estimator is used to estimate totals of the form:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\tau = \\sum_{i \\in U} y_{i}\\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $U$ is the underlying population of units (in networks it could be edges, triangles, nodes of certain degree ...), and the $y_i$ is the number associated to unit $i$. Often we simply want to calculate the number of units, and in these cases we set $y_i=1$ for every $i$. The HT estimator can be written as\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\hat{\\tau} = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\frac{y_{i}}{\\pi_{i}} \\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "### f. HT estimator\n",
    "Implement the HT estimator for the three sampling schemes. Given the selection probability $p$ for all cases, we will sample at least $n=100$ times to obtain distributions of some of our HT estimators, and to compare HT estimators with the empirical estimator (on the graph without any corrections). In other words, for each $p=0.3, 0.5$, and for each sampling scheme, obtain $n=100$ samples from the original network, calculate the HT estimator for the number triangles and for transitivity. For $p=0.5$ include also the empirical estimator, and for all plots include the true value. **Report your results in six plots**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\triangle}^n$ for $p=0.3, 0.5$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\triangle}$ for $p=0.5$.\n",
    "- The distribution of estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{C}^n$ for $p=0.3, 0.5$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_{C}$ for $p=0.5$.\n",
    "- The distribution of estimator $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\triangle}^e$ for $p=0.3, 0.5$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\triangle}$ for $p=0.5$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Elaborate** on the effect on sampling schemes and probabilities. Do the HT estimators lie near the true value? How do they vary? What are the main differences between sampling schemes? Do you notice anything particular about the sixth plot? If so, why is this?   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "Since we want to observe how different samples may arise from the same network, we need to take a large number of samples ($n=100$, for instance). However, while you are coding and testing it may be wise to use a smaller $n$. Keep in mind that if your code takes too much time to run on your computer, you can report results for a smaller $n$ or a smaller network."

Below is a description of two network data sets and their collection methods. **Match** the datasets with one of the three sampling methods used and HT estimators we derived in this exercise.

    "- A social communication network was built based on call data records of a mobile phone operator. These records contain all the incoming and outcoming calls the customers make and receive, but no data for the calls between pairs of customers who are both with a competitor. The network is built in a way that each phone number appearing in the data becomes a node and there is a link between them if there is at least one call between the numbers. The underlying network we would be interested in is the communication network between all the customers of all companies in the country it operates. The company has $6,421,148$ customers which amounts to a market share of 20\\% of customers in the country. The network contains $75,048,105$ nodes, $529,816,040$ links, and there are $153,328,324$ triangles and $15,856,481,566$ two-stars around our customers. Note that since our network contains all incoming and outgoing calls - including numbers in other countries, the number of customers is not equal to $20\\%$ of the network. \n",
    "- Using the same mobile phone data as above, we build a social network between the customers of the company. That is, we leave out the phone numbers which are not operated by our mobile phone operator. The underlying network we would be interested is the actual contact network between the company customers. Based on a small questionnaire we have made, on average only $10\\%$ of the contacts take place via mobile phones in that country at that time. The network contains $6,421,148$ nodes, $26,415,938$ links, $11,794,486$ triangles and $634,259,263$ two-stars."
