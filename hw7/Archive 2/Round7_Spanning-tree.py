# # Round 7. Network thresholding and spanning trees: the case of US air traffic
# In this exercise, we will get familiar with different approaches to thresholding networks, and also learn how they can be used for efficiently visualizing networks.
# 
# Now, you are given a network describing the US Air Traffic between 14th and 23rd December 2008 (http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/ ).
# 
# In the network, each node corresponds to an airport and link weights describe the number of flights between the airports during the time period.
# 
# The network is given in the file *aggregated_US_air_traffic_network_undir.edg*, and *us_airport_id_info.csv* contains information about names and locations of the airports.
# 
# This notebook can be used to complete the assignment. It contains a function for visualizing the air transport network and an example of how to use it. There is NO need to modify this function. You may start your solution after the subtitle "**Begin of the Exercise**" down below. In this exercise, you may also freely use all available networkx functions.

# # Begin of the exercise
# 
# Write your code here to calculate the required metrics, compute the thresholded network, maximal and minimal spanning tree, and visualize the networks. Remember you can use the networkx functions.
# 

# ### a. Basic properties
# When facing a new network, it is always good to first get some idea, how the network is like. Thus, compute and list the following basic network properties:
# - Number of network nodes N , number of links L, and density D
# - Network diameter d
# - Average clustering coefficient C
# 
# **Hint**: For the clustering coefficient, consider the undirected and unweighted version of the network, where two airports are linked if there is a flight between them in either direction.

# In[11]:


#Your solution here
# YOUR CODE HERE
no_node = net.number_of_nodes()
no_link = net.number_of_edges()
density = nx.density(net)
diameter = nx.diameter(net)
avc = nx.average_clustering(net.to_undirected(), nodes=None, weight=None, count_zeros=True)
#raise NotImplementedError()
print("number of node:" ,no_node)
print("number of link:" ,no_link)
print("density:" ,density)
print("diameter:" ,diameter)
print("average clustering coefficient:" ,avc)


# ### b. Visualization
# Visualize the full network with all links on top of the map of USA. The resulting figure is somewhat messy due to the large number of visible links.
# 
# **Hint**: use *fig.savefig('figure_name.pdf')* to save your figures in the notebook folder.

#Your solution here
# YOUR CODE HERE
fig,ax = plot_network_usa(net, xycoords, bg_figname, edges=None, alpha=0.3)
fig.savefig('full_network.pdf')
#raise NotImplementedError()


# ### c. Maximal and minimal spanning tree (MST)
# In order to reduce the number of plotted links, compute both the maximal and minimal spanning tree (MST) of the network and visualize them. Then, answer following questions:
# - If the connections of Hawaiâ€™i are considered, how would you explain the differences between the minimal and maximal spanning trees?
# - If you would like to understand the overall organization of the air traffic in the US, would you use the minimal or maximal spanning tree? Why?
# 
# **Hint**: For computing minimum spanning trees, use *nx.minimum_spanning_tree*. For computing maximum spanning trees, use *nx.maximum_spanning_tree*.

#Your solution here
# YOUR CODE HERE

fig,_=plot_network_usa(maxst, xycoords, bg_figname, edges=None, alpha=0.3)
fig.savefig('maximum_spanning_tree_vis.pdf')
#raise NotImplementedError()


# ### d. Thresholded networks
# Threshold and visualize the network by taking only the strongest M links into account, where M is the number of links in the MST. Then, answer following questions:
# - How many links does the thresholded network share with the maximal spanning tree?
# - Given this number and the visualizations, does simple thresholding yield a similar network as the maximum spanning tree?

strongest_edges = sorted_edges[:m]
