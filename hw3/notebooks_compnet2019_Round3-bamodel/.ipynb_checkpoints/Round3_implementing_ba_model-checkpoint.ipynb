    "# Round 3. Implementing the Barab치si-Albert (BA) model\n",
    "The Barab치si-Albert scale-free network model is a model of network growth, where new nodes continuously enter the network and make links to existing nodes with a probability that is linearly proportional to their degree. The steps required for generating a Barab치si-Albert scale-free network with $N$ nodes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a small seed network which has at least $m$ nodes, where $m$ is the number of links a new node creates to already existing nodes.  In this exercise, use a 3-clique as the seed network.\n",
    "- Add new nodes to the network until your network has $N$ nodes, such that each entering node has $m$ links and connects to existing nodes proportional to their degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will implement the model and investigate the networks it generates. The template file `implementing_ba_model.py` is provided which covers most of the plotting and binning required for this exercise. This notebook has the same functions as the template and can be used for solving the exercise too. This would let you focus on the actual implementation of the model. Using the template or the notebook is \\textbf{optional}. Then you only need to fill in the required functions. Some of the functions do NOT need modifications. You may start your solution after the subtitle \"**Begin of the Exercise**\" down below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to returning a short report of your results (including the visualizations), return also your commented Python code or notebook. Remember to label the axes in your figures!"

    "- For the interested: When plotting the degree PDF, you may end up with empty bins with small values of $k$. (Consider e.g. if you had a bin [3.1, 3.9]: this bin would always have value zero.) To circumvent this, it is often practical to bin degree-distributions using  `lin-log` bins: [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, \\ldots, 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 16.5, \\ldots ] so that one does not end up with empty bins with small values of $k$. \\textbf{If you wish}, you may bin your data using logarithmic bins or this more sophisticated approach of `lin-log` bins."
