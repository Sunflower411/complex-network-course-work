# # Round 6. Centrality measures for undirected networks
# 
# In this exercise, we get familiar with some common centrality measures by applying them to undirected networks (although these measures can all be generalized also to directed networks).
# 
# Below, we list and define the measures used in this exercise:
# 1. degree $k(i)$: Number of neighbors of node $i$
# 2. betweenness centrality $bc(i)$: Number of shortest paths between other nodes of the network that pass through node $i$. However, if there exist several shortest paths between a given pair of nodes, then the contribution of that node pair to the betweenness of $i$ is given by the fraction of those paths that contain $i$. The betweenness scores are also normalized by $(N-1)(N-2)$, i.e. the number of all node-pairs of the network, excluding pairs that contain $i$ (because paths starting or ending in node $i$ do not contribute to the betweenness of $i$), which is the maximum possible score. Formally, if $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ and $\sigma_{sit}$ the number of such paths that contain $i$, then $\big[bc(i) = \frac{1}{(N-1)(N-2)}\sum_{s\neq i} \sum_{t\neq i} \dfrac{\sigma_{sit}}{\sigma_{st}}\big]$.
# 3. closeness centrality $C(i)$: Inverse of the average shortest path distance to all other nodes than $i$: $\bigg[C(i) = \dfrac{N-1}{\sum\limits_{v\neq i}d(i,v)}\bigg]$.
# 4. $k$-shell $k_s(i)$: Node $i$ belongs to the $k$-shell, if it belongs to the $k$-core of the network but does not belong to the $k+1$-core. The $k$-core is the maximal subnetwork (i.e. the largest possible subset of the network's nodes, and the links between them) where all nodes have at least degree $k$. In other words, the 1-core is formed by removing nodes of degree 0 (isolated nodes) from the network, the 2-core is formed by removing nodes of degree 1 and iteratively removing the nodes that become degree 1 or 0 because of the removal, the 3-core is formed by removing nodes of degree less than 3 and those nodes that become of degree less than 3 because of the removals, and so on. The 1-shell is then the set of nodes that was removed from the 1-core to obtain the 2-core.
# 5. eigenvector centrality $e(i)$: Eigenvector centrality is a generalization of degree that takes into account the degrees of the node's neighbors, and recursively the degrees of the neighbors of neighbors, and so on. It is defined as the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue.

# ### a. Centrality measures (pen and paper)
# Your first task is to compute/reason without a computer the first 4 centrality measures of the above list for the network shown in Fig. 1 (i.e. using pen-and-paper; note that you do not need to compute the eigenvector centrality, as one then would need to compute the eigenvalues of a 5Ã—5 matrix which can be a bit painful). In your computations, use the definitions given above and show also intermediate steps where necessary.

# ### b. Centrality measures (NetworkX)
# Use NetworkX to compute all five centrality measures for the networks shown in Fig 2 (small_cayley_tree.edg, larger_lattice.edg, small_ring.edg) as well as for the Karate club network (karate_club_network_edge_file.edg). Then, visualize betweenness, closeness, k-shell, and eigenvector centrality as a function of degree in a scatter plot for each of the networks. For easier visual comparison of the measures, you should normalize the k-shell values by dividing them by the maximal k-shell value. 
# **Hint**: For some of the networks, the power iteration algorithm used by NetworkX to calculate eigenvector centrality may not converge. In this case, increase the value of the tolerance (tol) parameter of `eigenvector_centrality()` until the iteration converges.
